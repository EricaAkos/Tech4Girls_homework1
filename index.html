    <h1>My Experience As A Tech4Girls Scholar</h1>
    <h2>Soft Skills</h2> 
    <p></p>
</body>As a girl who didn't know much about IT, I decided to grab this opportunity as soon as a friend introduced 
<b>HACSA Tech4Girls</b> to me. At the begining of the program, we started with soft skills, namely; <b>leadership, problem solving,
critical thinking, social media marketing, public speaking, and entrepreneurship.</b>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>We later started with the <i>technology</i> aspect of the program which is fun but daunting as well. <br>Like the saying goes 
<b>"nothing comes easy"</b>, but I believe with time and constant practice, it's going to be much easier and fun.</p>
<p>I would like to recommend this course to all other girls and women out there. <b>Let's all come out of our comfort zone</b>
and <u>gain new and educative experiences</u> <i>for better days ahead.</i>
